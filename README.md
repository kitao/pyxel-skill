# pyxel-skill

A [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) Skill that drives end-to-end production of **playable, clearable, recognizable-sprite** Pyxel games. Combines a phased workflow harness with topical knowledge files and an enforcement hook that prevents the agent from declaring "done" with placeholder garbage.

This skill orchestrates the workflow; [`pyxel-mcp`](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel-mcp) (≥ 0.10.0) provides the verification verbs (`run`, `validate`, `inspect_*`, `render_audio`, `compare_frames`).

## Status

`v0.2.0` — built on top of pyxel-mcp's 9-tool redesign (0.10.0). 7-stage pipeline; 13-check quality gate (15 in newer roadmap drafts). Donkey Kong is the canonical validation target — see `docs/validation/dk-reference.md`.

## Pipeline

```
visual-target  →  decomposer  →  scaffold  →  asset-planner  →  asset-gen
                                                                     ↓
                                              quality-gate  ←  task-execution
```

Each stage writes / refines persistent state at project root (`PLAN.md`, `STRUCTURE.md`, `ASSETS.md`, `MEMORY.md`) so long sessions survive context compaction. Stage entry checks the existing files and resumes where you left off.

The quality gate is the **single source of "done"**. It runs every sprite identity check, win-path playthrough, lose-path playthrough, audio render, and palette analysis; emits `screenshots/result/<N>/gate-report.json`. The agent cannot self-certify completion — only a clean gate passes.

## Anti-shortcut enforcement

Built-in guard rails (see `SKILL.md`'s "Anti-shortcut rules"):

- **Visual primacy** — when code says X happened but the captured frame shows Y, the capture wins.
- **No procedural fallback** — `pyxel.rect(x,y,16,16,8)` for a player body means asset-gen was skipped; gate FAILs.
- **No "looks fine"** — every Verify is a specific predicate against an observed value.
- **No bundle, no done** — `screenshots/result/<N>/` with win-path GIF, lose-path GIF, frame PNGs, audio WAVs is the precondition for declaring complete.
- **No mid-attempt threshold relaxation** — quality-gate thresholds are committed before a run; changing them during a run is documented in gate-report.json and forces an automatic FAIL.

## Install

1. Clone this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kitao/pyxel-skill.git
   ```

2. Symlink it into your Claude Code skills directory:

   ```bash
   ln -s "$(pwd)/pyxel-skill" ~/.claude/skills/pyxel
   ```

3. Install the Stop hook (one-time per machine):

   ```bash
   ~/.claude/skills/pyxel/hooks/install.sh
   ```

   Non-blocking warning at session end if the quality gate was skipped. Idempotent.

4. Ensure `pyxel-mcp ≥ 0.10.0` is in your MCP config:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "pyxel": { "command": "uvx", "args": ["pyxel-mcp"] }
     }
   }
   ```

## Use

Activate the skill by asking Claude Code:

> Make a Donkey Kong style platformer in Pyxel.

The skill walks the 7-stage pipeline, calls `pyxel-mcp` tools at each verification point, and produces a `screenshots/result/<N>/` proof bundle. A typical end-to-end run is hundreds of `run`/`inspect_*` calls — fast because pyxel-mcp's headless mode is sub-second per playthrough.
