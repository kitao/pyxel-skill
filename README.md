# pyxel-skill

Standalone distribution of the Pyxel workflow skill. It is kept aligned with the skill bundled in [`pyxel-mcp`](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel-mcp), but can be installed directly into a host skill directory.

This skill orchestrates the workflow; pyxel-mcp (≥ 1.0.0) provides the 9 observation verbs (`run`, `validate`, `read_*`, `diff_frames`, `pyxel_info`). Quality verification is the agent's responsibility — the agent asserts predicates directly in Python against `state` snapshots and visually reviews captured PNG bundles against PLAN.md / ASSETS.md anchors. There are no judge tools or engine-wide taste scores.

## Status

`v1.1.0` — built on top of pyxel-mcp's 1.0 9-tool surface. 7-stage pipeline; compact quality gate; proof bundle with visual review before handoff.

## Pipeline

```
visual-target  →  decomposer  →  scaffold  →  asset-planner  →  asset-gen
                                                                     ↓
                                              quality-gate  ←  task-execution
```

Each stage writes / refines persistent state at project root (`PLAN.md`, `STRUCTURE.md`, `ASSETS.md`, `MEMORY.md`) so long sessions survive context compaction. Stage entry checks the existing files and resumes where you left off.

The quality gate is the **single source of "done"**. It runs 11 stop conditions: state files exist, validate clean, smoke run, win-path variability, lose-path direct asserts, difficulty floor, audio peaks + notes, proof bundle integrity, tilemap trap clean, genre-identity Python predicates, and agent visual review that catches static bundles. Emits `screenshots/result/<N>/gate-report.json`. The agent cannot self-certify completion — only a clean gate passes.

## Anti-shortcut enforcement

Built-in guard rails (see `SKILL.md`'s "Anti-shortcut rules"):

- **Visual primacy** — when code says X happened but the captured frame shows Y, the capture wins.
- **No asset fallback** — a solid placeholder in place of a declared sprite means asset-gen was skipped; gate FAILs.
- **No "looks fine"** — every Verify is a specific Python predicate against an observed value.
- **Bundle integrity** — a bundle whose first 3 seconds are correct and the rest is static is FAIL, not partial pass.
- **No bundle, no done** — `screenshots/result/<N>/` with win/lose path media, frame PNGs, audio WAVs is the precondition for declaring complete.
- **No user-handoff without agent visual review** — agent must `Read` every bundle frame and verbalize against PLAN.md milestones before the gate PASSes.

## Install

First ensure `pyxel-mcp >= 1.0.0` is registered as an MCP server under the `pyxel` namespace:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pyxel": { "command": "uvx", "args": ["pyxel-mcp"] }
  }
}
```

Then install this repository as a host-native skill:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/src ~/.claude/skills
git clone https://github.com/kitao/pyxel-skill.git ~/src/pyxel-skill
test ! -e ~/.claude/skills/pyxel
ln -s ~/src/pyxel-skill ~/.claude/skills/pyxel
```

If `~/.claude/skills/pyxel` already exists, move or remove it before installing. Choose one install path; do not overlay the standalone skill and the bundled copy at the same target.

Alternative: install the bundled pyxel-mcp 1.0 workflow content:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
test ! -e ~/.claude/skills/pyxel
uvx pyxel-mcp publish-skill ~/.claude/skills/pyxel
```

Restart your client. The skill activates on phrases like "make a Pyxel game", "build a retro shooter", or "create a pixel-art platformer in Pyxel".

Optional: install the Stop hook for a non-blocking tripwire if the quality gate is skipped:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/pyxel/hooks/install.sh
```

The hook installer is idempotent.

## Use

Activate the skill by asking your client:

> Make a compact arcade platformer in Pyxel.

The skill walks the 7-stage pipeline, calls pyxel-mcp tools at each verification point, and produces a `screenshots/result/<N>/` proof bundle. A typical end-to-end run is hundreds of `run` / `read_*` / `diff_frames` calls — fast because pyxel-mcp's headless mode is sub-second per playthrough.
